== Description ==

This extension provides realtime address autocompletion lookup on your address forms, including billing and shipping. Ideal Postcodes address tools validates and accelerates customer entered address information to reduce cart abandonment and ensure correct delivery address capture.

Ideal Postcodes provides address autocomplete for your WooCommerce address forms. We specialize in the UK addressing data, drawing the most up-to-date & accurate UK dataset from Royal Mail on a daily basis. We have over 1,000 clients that use our address validation tools to speed up checkout, increase deliverability, and ensure data quality.

This extension is free to download and install. However, our address validation services requires a paid account at [ideal-postcodes.co.uk](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk).
