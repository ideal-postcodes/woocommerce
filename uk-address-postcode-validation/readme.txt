Ideal Postcodes provides address autocomplete for your WooCommerce address forms. We specialize in the UK addressing data, drawing the most up-to-date & accurate UK dataset from Royal Mail on a daily basis. We have over 1,000 clients that use our address validation tools to speed up checkout, increase deliverability, and ensure data quality.

This extension is free to download and install. However, our address validation services requires a paid account at [ideal-postcodes.co.uk](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk).

*Important.* If you are using Postcode Lookup consider checking the styling of our Postcode Lookup tools on your checkout and user address book. This is particularly important if you are using custom styling to adapt our Postcode Lookup to your theme.

As always, please drop by chat (chat.ideal-postcodes.co.uk) if you have any questions about this change.

This update brings accessibility, usability and consistency improvements to our Postcode Lookup tools. In order to do this, the update reorganises Postcode Lookup HTML elements which may require you to update any custom styling you may have applied.

New Features:

* More custom styling options for Address Finder and Postcode Lookup

Breaking Changes:

* Both Postcode Lookup and Address Finder have been replaced. This means the any custom library overrides on the admin page will need to be translated into the new setup format.
